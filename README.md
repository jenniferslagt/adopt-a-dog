## Description
An app (made for mobile) where you can possibly adopt a dog! Choose a dog breed, dislike or (super) like and get to meet your best buddy!
Even though I started with making a simple design in Figma, this project is mainly focused on learning how to work with an API!

## Practices
* ES6 modules
* API
* Fetch & Promises
* Async await
* Get data into the DOM
* Try & Catch
* Animation JS library

## Feedback
Ofcourse.. There are always things that I can improve! Here some feedback from myself:
* The images of the Dog API have a bad resolution.
* Can you send a parameter from one module to another? In this way it could be easier to split up the JS code into more modules.
* The try/catch block is something you actually use in situations that could likely fail. That chance is in this case small, so the block is not necessarry. For this same reason I imported a .json file instead of a .js file. (I kept it just to show that I understand how it works)
* Note that there are a lot of comments in the JS code. I wouldn't do this in a real project, but remember that the goal is to learn from these projects on github. So these explanations are just to help.
