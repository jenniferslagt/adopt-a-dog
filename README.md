# Adopt a dog app (IN PROGRESS)


## Description
An app (made for mobile) where you can possibly adopt a dog! Choose a dog breed, dislike or (super) like and get to meet your best buddy!
Even though I started with making a simple design in Figma, this project is mainly focused on learning how to work with an API!

## Practices
* ES6 modules
* API
* Fetch & Promises
* Async await
* Get data into the DOM
* Try & Catch
