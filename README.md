# Adopt a dog app (IN PROGRESS)


## Description
An app (made for mobile) where you can possibly adopt a dog! Choose a dog breed, dislike or (super) like and get to meet your best buddy!
Even though I started with making a simple design in Figma, this project is mainly focused on learning how to work with an API!

## Practices
* ES6 modules
* API
* Fetch & Promises
* Async await
* Get data into the DOM
* Try & Catch

## Feedback
Ofcourse.. There are always things that I can improve! Here some feedback from myself:
* The images of the Dog API have a bad resolution.
* Can you send a parameter from one module to another? In this way it could be easier to split up the JS code into more modules.
* The try/catch block is something you actually use in situations that could likely fail. That chance is in this case small, so the block is not necessarry. (I kept it just to show that I understand how it works)
* Note that there are a lot of comments in the JS code. I wouldn't do this in a real project, but remember that the goal is to learn from these projects on github. So these explanations are just to help.
